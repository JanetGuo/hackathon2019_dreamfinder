Microsoft,AI Centre Postdoctoral Fellow,Bengaluru (IN),"Microsoft Research India invites applications for its AI Centre Postdoctoral Fellows Program.

Candidates who have completed their PhDs are eligible to apply. 
Submit your application now for early consideration.

 

Microsoft Research (MSR) India is a thought leader in developing and deploying technologies for socioeconomic development. We have a strong legacy of work in the understanding of challenges faced by under-served communities. We have also fostered innovative interventions with demonstrable impact across domains such as healthcare, agriculture and education. Our work on TB medication adherence (99 DOTS) has led to broad deployment not only in India, but also in Myanmar and Africa. Digital Green, an NGO working on agricultural extension using videos, came out of research from our lab. IVR junction, a platform for grassroots citizen journalism, is widely used in developing countries across the world. We see a huge opportunity in the potential of technology for societal impact and take our collaborative engagements to the next level. To that end, MSR India is creating a new program to work with academia, government and entrepreneurs to help incubate technologies for societal impact, with special emphasis on Cloud and AI platforms. This program is focused on applying AI-based technology to address societal problems, in collaboration with NGOs and organizations working on these problems.

Responsibilities
The AI Centre Postdoctoral Fellow position at Microsoft Research India offers an opportunity for selected candidates to have a hands-on experience in understanding societal problems, identifying feasible solutions, and dealing with challenges in deploying such solutions. Fellows are expected to contribute to various aspects of a project lifecycle spanning ideation, implementation, evaluation, and deployment. Candidates must also be able to collaborate effectively with other researchers, product development teams and external collaborators.

Postdoctoral Fellows spend 1 to 2 years at MSR India. During their tenure, each postdoctoral Fellow will receive ongoing guidance and mentoring from an experienced researcher at Microsoft Research.

Microsoft,Research Associate: Reinforcement Learning,Cambridge (UK),"We are looking for a Research Associate in Reinforcement Learning at the University of Oxford. The role is a partnership between Microsoft Research Cambridge (UK) and The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning group at the Department of Computer Science. Reporting to Professor Shimon Whiteson and working in close collaboration with Katja Hofmann at Microsoft Research (MSRC), you will be conducting original research in the area of Reinforcement Learning. The position incorporates a one day a week secondment to MSRC, and upon completion of this contract, is expected to be followed by a 6 month stint at MSRC.

 

Please note that you should also apply online using the University of Oxford�s application system. This can be found at: https://www.recruit.ox.ac.uk/pls/hrisliverecruit/erq_jobspec_details_form.jobspec?p_id=140802

The closing date for applications is 12 noon on 21 June 2019.

Responsibilities
The project will focus on developing and analysing state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods for application to video games, and aims to tackle two key challenges. Firstly, building effective game AI with RL requires dramatically scaling up existing tools for cooperative multi-agent RL, in which teams of agents must collaborate to complete tasks.  Doing so requires new methods for performing multi-agent credit assignment and multi-agent exploration in large state and action spaces.  Secondly, effective game AI must also be able to transfer effectively to new scenarios, such as new game levels and versions, without having to learn from scratch. Doing so requires new methods for transfer and meta-learning in RL that scale to the complexity of modern video games.


Qualifications
You will hold a PhD/DPhil (or be close to completion) in Computer Science or related discipline together with relevant experience, and have a strong publication record in machine learning or closely-related area. Experience with reinforcement learning and/or machine learning for gaming is highly desirable.

a track record of publication in top-tier conferences or other evidence of significant contributions to this or a related field,
a proven ability and desire to spin up quickly on new topics and techniques
and a commitment to seeing an idea from conception and prototyping through to deployment and production.
A PhD is highly desirable, but others with equivalent experience are invited to apply. We are doing incredible work that will reshape research in dialogue systems, and we are committed to sharing that work with the community. You can expect to continue to publish the results of your research if you like. 

Tools 

We're a small group and want to use the right tools for each project. Experience in the languages & systems we're using is an asset but not a requirement; perhaps you will bring new ideas and help improve the way we work. We are currently writing in Scala/Java, Python, Typescript, and C++. Our production systems, as well as our research clusters, are deployed on AWS.
